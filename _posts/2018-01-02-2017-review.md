The last year was probably the most busy, chaotic, and yet interesting year in my life so far, both personally and professionally. Will 2018 beat it?

2017 started with [devconf.cz](http://devconf.cz/) where I participated in the [Diversity FAD](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-diversity-fad-2017/), discussing all kinds of issues within the Fedora community, surveys and code of conduct. A few months later I was presenting about an interesting technology combination on several conferences, I even got to organize some. .NET Core on Linux is an interesting topic and has great potential. It's very cool to see Microsoft evolve and learn about Open Source, it's even funny sometimes. Everyone makes mistakes, right? Like the first C#-on-Linux presentation I had at Red Hat Open House [in April]({{ site.url }}/articles/2017-04/RedHat-OpenHouse) where the room was so full that people were standing in the door, and AC was failing to do anything about the heat. I flew through that twice faster than I wanted to. Way too hot. [The next conference]({{ site.url }}/articles/2017-07/Microsoft-TechTalks-Prague) wasn't much better, however this time it was the lack of microphone in combination with my vocal cord paralysis in front of 150 Microsoft engineers and dotnet enthusiasts. Finally, the next two went well, one of which I organized - that was a smaller event, [Fedora Women's Day]({{ site.url }}/articles/2017-10/FWD-Brno). Important nontheless, go girls!

I got to rewrite [Botwinder](http://botwinder.info/docs), my little pet project. `C#` / `.NET Core`, and Fedora Linux server with a lot of services, `MySQL` (mariadb) database. And `PHP` / `Laravel` page written by Eric to go with it. The new version is cluster-ready, or in other words - it can scale horizontally. Sadly there are all kinds of issues with the underlying library that we use, but I have my hopes up that they will fix it one day. I don't have the time to contribute to that as well.

Summer was awesome. Summer was just awesome. We went on all kinds of [mini-holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XBS2CLM4jk) weekends with Eric, on our bikes. [I love my bike.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZyzFQP1Rb8) Did I mention that I sold my car to buy it? Wasn't enough. The bike was seven times more than the 20 years old car was worth. I did love my car too though... worth it anyway **:]**

[Eluveitie](https://twitter.com/RheaAyase/status/924624315500433409) was awesome. Went to their concert and got to see `Amaranthe` as well. And `The Charm The Fury`. Fun night with my sister and her husband <3

Winter is awesome, it still is `:p` - I'm in Sweden, been for last two weeks. Just check it out, **all the snow!**

Oh and I'm now [Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa) - baby steps, huh? And what about the next steps? Well, I will be presenting the whole C#-on-Linux thing at [devconf.cz](http://devconf.cz/) _around the corner_ in Brno, and then at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2018/) in Brussels. I also signed up for [RHCE (Red Hat Certified Engineer)](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhce) in May. And we will be moving to a new apartment together with Eric. Baby steps, still?

#### Happy and successful new year! =)
