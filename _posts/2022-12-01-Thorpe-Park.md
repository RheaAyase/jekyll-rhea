This is a story of self discovery, freedom of expression, passion and responsibility. Based on real events and characters, it takes shape of an irregular diary, a collection of small independent stories. Featuring BDSM lifestyle, some may consider it to be NSFW, however it is but a day in my life. Certainly 18+ though! So do not proceed if you're not of age or maturity.

### Thorpe Park

I woke up in the morning, had a dream about crazy rides in an amusement park. Reminded me of our first date. I went to wake her up, sat on the side of her bed. Grabbed her hand by her wrist, I said "wakey wakey." - "Good morning Mistress," she replied. I said "Remember Thorpe park?" Her tail started to wag under the blanket - using her leg.

_We were waiting in an endless queue,_
_She stepped on my shoe._
_I was holding a jacket in my hand,_
_I passed it to George, our friend._

_I rushed a hand behind her head,_
_Firm was my grip on her hair,_
_The other on her neck denying air,_
_Pushing her hard against the wall,_
_Protecting her head after all._

_The crowd in distress,_
_"I'm sorry Mistress."_
_A kiss on her lips,_
_The crowd now giggles._
