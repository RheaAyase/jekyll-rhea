This is a story of self discovery, freedom of expression, passion and responsibility. Based on real events and characters, it takes shape of an irregular diary, a collection of small independent stories. Featuring BDSM lifestyle, some may consider it to be NSFW, however it is but a day in my life. Certainly 18+ though! So do not proceed if you're not of age or maturity.

### Thorpe Park

I woke up in the morning, had a dream about crazy rides in an amusement park. Reminded me of our first date. I went to wake her up, sat on the side of her bed. Grabbed her hand by her wrist, I said "wakey wakey." - "Good morning Mistress," she replied. I said "Remember Thorpe park?" Her tail started to wag under the blanket - using her leg.

_We were waiting in an endless queue,_
<br>_She stepped on my shoe._
<br>_I was holding a jacket in my hand,_
<br>_I passed it to George, our friend._

_I rushed a hand behind her head,_
<br>_Firm was my grip on her hair,_
<br>_The other on her neck denying air,_
<br>_Pushing her hard against the wall,_
<br>_Protecting her head after all._

_The crowd in distress,_
<br>_"I'm sorry Mistress."_
<br>_A kiss on her lips,_
<br>_The crowd now giggles._
