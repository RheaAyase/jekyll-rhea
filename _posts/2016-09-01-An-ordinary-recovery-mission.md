### Day One

 &nbsp; I took a contract to recover lost cargo from crashed vessel. It was on some agricultural planet - night side. So I was chasing jettisoned cargo from damaged ship, in the atmosphere. They dropped it at high speed before ejecting themselves, to save it from the destruction. It got far enough from the crash site to be out of sensor range, so i didn't really know where it was...
<br /> &nbsp; I was flying my Fer deLance in the general direction of their original heading, when I was met with several eagles and even an anaconda flying straight at me. I dropped it down to literally licking the ground, trying to get them to crash as they were chasing me.
<br /> &nbsp; When I managed to shake them off, I almost hit a ground vehicle in the field, i immediately turned the ship around and landed, perhaps they know something about the cargo... The "tiny" vehicle had just arrived as I was walking down the ramp. The air was lovely fresh, i could smell burnt crops thanks to my thrusters... Illuminated from the back by my ship lights, all they could see was just my shadow. I was wearing heavy combat flight suit, somewhat armoured navy issue that would provide decent protection against small personal weapons. Navy would use these in action in case of being boarded. Despite wearing this, it felt really good to feel real gravity, the breeze in my wavy hair... I spent way too much time in the void.

 &nbsp; _"Hey there!"_ someone shouted from the vehicle as I was walking towards them. I could clearly see that it was an old but in very good shape car, jeep is what it's called i think. It was big one for that, Three guys jumped out of it, i could see two more figures sitting inside, judging from their hair likely women. _"Hello"_ I said and smiled as we finally met. They were young people, not more than 20 years old, making me feel a bit old considering my military and combat ranks, however i'm still only 25! _"What's going on? We heard some explosions and then you appeared out of nowhere..."_ One of them asked, the driver. Handsome young man i'll have to admit. _"Well, I came here on a mission to retrieve a cargo container from a ship that crashed a few hundred kilometers west, and as I was looking for it I was surprised by a wing of Eagles and even some bigger ships that frankly, should never enter atmosphere, hehe.. I dropped my flight level to just a few meters above the ground, those explosions were two of them crashing into the ground in the dark... Eagles are not famous for their lights."_ I explained what happened... _"Anyway you guys don't happen to know anything about the cargo in question?"_ They were slightly amazed by my words, I would guess that they've never seen a dogfight or any kind of proper combat vessel before. They shook their heads without words. _"Damn... I'll have to resume my search in the morning... what are you guys doing out here at night anyway?"_ I was curious why were they out of the city at night, young people, obviously not working a nightshift. _"Heh we were..."_ - _"Party girl, wanna join us?"_ The driver got interrupted by a younger one. I was indeed tempted, to have a bit of fun, to get to know new people and most importantly to eat something and get some rest... _"Sure, lead the way!"_ I bowed the imperial way, smiled and turned around swinging my hair in the breeze, back to the ship then.

 &nbsp; By the time I got to the bridge and seated my imperial bum, their vehicle had already turned around, lined up in front of the nose of my ship. I flipped some switches, engaged the thrusters and even the Flight Assist. I didn't want to risk burning their tiny vehicle with too much thrust by accident. I had gently pushed the vertical throttle hat up, when they started to move forward. I've set the throttle to about 1 millimeter forward, ground vehicles top speed in the off-road terrain is but a few meters per second, not more than 20. These civilian vehicles are nowhere near as complex piece of technology as the Scarab in the vehicle bay of my ship. I followed them but a few kilometers, til we arrived to something like a camp-site, no solid buildings, just a few tents with a fire in the middle. I liked this a lot, freedom, no ships anywhere near, just two other vehicles parked nearby next to each other. The vehicle i was following stopped next to those, I went to set my ship down right next to them, with the exit out of my ship towards the camp. I walked down to already see a few people standing by the tents, observing carefully my Fer deLance. You could tell that they really do not see spaceships often.
<br /> &nbsp; The driver was running towards the ramp as I was walking down... The young man whos name was yet to be revealed was smiling, _"Get comfortable, you look like you need some rest, perhaps take that armour of yours off?"_ he asked. I did not intend to go there in my heavy flight suit, but I did not have any casual clothes that would suit the outside temperature - I do not deal with cold weather well and it was below 20 degrees celsius... All my clothes were fit for controlled environments between 20 and 25. _"I'm afraid that I do not have any appropriate clothing for this cold summer night. Kirea, close the ramp."_ Â Kirea is the name of my Fer deLance. Entrance to the ship closed and and my host, i guess, gestured towards the camp. _"What's your name then?"_ I asked as we walked. The blonde young man said _"Eric, what about you?"_ - _"Rhea, Commander Rhea Ayase. Pleased to meet you,"_ I smiled at him.

 &nbsp; Everyone was already back to drinking colorful alcohol in transparent cups. _"So... would you like something to eat? We've got some meat to be roasted on the fire.."_ he asked, trying to be nice. I looked at the fire, there were some people sitting around it, looking at me. I nodded, I was hungry and i wouldn't mind real food for a change. _"Hey!"_ some of the guys greeted me at the fire as we sat down, while the girls that were clinging to the two guys were obviously drunk, unable to react to the situation in time. The youngest one out of the few sitting by the fire started a conversation _"So you're a pilot huh? You look like one of those arrogant imperials officers... no offense, sorry."_ I got a little surprised, well, it is true that imperial officers are arrogant, but i'm no imperial officer. _"Hehe, none taken. I am ranked high in the Imperial navy, that is true, but I am not in active service and I work as contractor only."_ Eric sitting next to me stabbed a piece of round meat with a wooden stick, and placed it into fire while I was answering, then he looked at me _"Oh that's interesting. So what's your rank?"_ I smiled at him, "I'm Elite." They were surprised, probably because of my age. _"I've never heard of Elite Commander so young. How old are you if you don't mind me asking?"_ asked the other guy, while holding a girl who was sleeping. _"About as old as the Princess hehe,"_ I chuckled.
<br /> &nbsp; _"Isn't it lonely out there?"_ Eric kept staring at my face. _"Sometimes, when I travel long distances, it does get very lonely, however I spend most of the time chasing off bandits, negotiating trades and escorting cargo ships, it's often either full of action, or casual chatter with traders. They are nice guys, they won't try to kill me at least."_ I explained what is my life about in those few sentences, looking into fire... it was mesmerizing... _"Here,"_ he passed me the stick, i would hold it in the fire like he did, while he turned around and grabbed some bread. _"You have to turn it, otherwise it will burn on one side..."_ he would gently touch my hands and guide the meat a little bit higher above the flames _"and hold it just above the tip of the flame, that's where the temperature is just perfect."_ I just nodded, with big eyes on my face... _"What do you eat while you're in your ship for days?"_ - _"Well, the usual long lasting food is packed in air tight squeezed bags. You plug it into water dispenser, it will issue exact amount of hot water, and then you leave it for a few minutes to settle, it provides proper nutrition and you can get really huge variety of meals at every station or spaceport."_ He shook his head _"It doesn't sound very tasty, here it should be done"_ he gave me the stick while he was holding the bread _"place it here on the bread, i'll hold it, and you pull the stick out."_ I have done so, and then he gave me the food. _"So, how is it?"_ I took a bite... _"mhmmm..."_ and I had kinda full mouth. _"I've never had something so good..."_

 &nbsp; We carried our discussion for a while, some other people would sit by and talk to me, I was telling them stories about some of my interesting missions and mysteries I had solved... it was getting late and cold, I felt it even in the flight suit. The thermo regulation activates only with remlok mask. Eric saw it on me and wrapped his old-style leather jacket around my shoulders. I haven't felt this nice for a long time, they were very friendly and nice to me - especially Eric. I was just smiling and looking into the fire while listening to one of the guys talking about some metal construction sticking out of the field... how he thinks that there is ancient city underneath these fields. Eric sat closer and pulled me to lean against him. I fell asleep in his arms.

### Day Two

 &nbsp; I wake up, take a deep breath, and upon smelling the fresh natural air, I realise where I am... I find myself in a tent... covered by a blanket, on a soft foam mat, with a man laying next to me. He is turned away from me. He looks like he's cold, without blanket, and laying only on the cold ground. The tent was small, obviously intended only for one person. The young man laying next to me was Eric, the blond driver who made the yummy piece of food for me. I covered him with the blanket, but he woke up and looked at me. _"Good morning,"_ he said. _"Thank you"_ was my reply, i felt... i felt happy, someone took care of me after all.. I've not felt like this since... since ever. Since I lost my family in the Scion massacre nearly ten years ago. I think that this was the moment when I realised that I'm in love.

 &nbsp; _"Warning, ship under attack!"_ a female voice communication interrupted the moment. I immediately required more information _"Kirea, status report."_ - _"All systems functioning with shields at ninety-six percent."_ That is okay. I always leave my shields at full power when leaving the ship, that bit of extra fuel may be worth it as I learned over the years... _"Kirea extend the shields to cover the whole campsite and report on hostiles."_ - _"Two fighter-class ships."_ I have to act quickly, keeping the shield at this size will drain all the power very quickly, it won't last long. I look at Eric, he's all pale. _"How many friends do you have here?"_ - _"uhm... we were nine in total."_ Great, that's awesome. Fer deLance is neither transport ship, nor a luxury liner, it is meant to be piloted by one or two people in total with no extra crew, however it does have deployable seats, two in the bridge access corridor, six on the bridge. I took his hand and dragged him out ordering my ship to keep me posted _"Kirea report every 20% drop in the shield strength."_ - _"Acknowledged, shields are at 82%."_ Shit. It's dropping faster than I expected. _"Make sure that everyone is calm, we can't afford to lose time because someone is panicking! Tell everyone to board my ship!"_ - _"But we can't abandon our cars!"_ - _"I can't~ [b]- Shields at 62% -[/b] ..I can't protect you out here! I'll have to engage them and someone may get hurt in the crossfire!"_ I ran to the ship as fast as the damn heavy suit would allow me to, while he went around the camp to get everyone moving.
<br /> &nbsp; _"Kirea open the ramp!"_ I get to the cockpit just to hear another shields warning, it's down to 42%. I immediately engage drives, i can't deploy hardpoints while the ramp is open, it's blocking the huge beam laser underneath the belly. I run to the back of the bridge to prepare emergency seats, I hear them stomping up the ramp. I tell them to continue to the bridge to take seats there, counting how many pass by me - getting the last two to the hallway seats. _"Shields at 22%"_ I could see how much more everyone got scared at the sound of that.They were all seated, I grabbed Eric's hand and dragged him over to the cockpit, he sat next to me, looking at me. I had very serious expression on my face. silently I grabbed the controls, slammed the vertical throttle up, accelerating at two G's upwards while instructing the ship to return shields to normal.
<br /> &nbsp; Hardpoints deployed, we are in the air. _"Shields at 2%"_ - _"Shut up!!!"_ I slammed the throttle to full forward and engaged boost. We went from zero to 400 m/s in matter of seconds, everyone was groaning behind me, then it was quiet. Most of them passed out. They've never experienced more than one, maybe two G of acceleration on the ground, they couldn't handle the 15g that Fer deLance can push when boosting from zero. _"Shields offline."_ I'm happy. I know that my ship is very well armored and everyone is safe inside even without shields, but oh my, that repair bill is going to be huge. _"Oh my god"_ said Eric, he did not pass out, having the advantage of an actual flight seat, however he was obviously not doing very well, without any previous training. _"It's okay, don't worry."_ I calmly said, _"hold on though, this won't be comfortable ride."_ I flipped the damn Flight Assist off, slammed the stick back as hard as i could, pitching up and 180 degree in but a fraction of a second, I then slammed the throttle back to full forward, pointing my huge laser beam at one of the Eagles. I managed to take out half of his shields before I pitched up again, another 180 degrees flying in reverse. Completely ignoring the aerodynamics thanks to my overpowered thrusters. As soon as I finished the maneuver sensors indicated that the eagle was just passing by, so I went to full forward again, I ended up right behind his ass. It was a quick business from here on. I triggered my railguns and Eagle exploded. _"Frame shift surge detected"_ - _"Heh that coward is running..."_ I let the other one go, and turn the ship around, slowly flying back towards the camp. _"Shield restored."_ Kirea announced. _"I'm so sorry, i didn't realise that they will track me down. I'm so sorry! Is everyone okay back there?!"_ They were fine, just a bunch of bruises and i made them sick...

 &nbsp; As we landed I instructed my ship to extend the shield again, just to be safe. Eric turned at me _"Seems like they didn't damage anything, all our things are fine... I'm sorry about your ship"_ - _"She will be fixed, don't worry, important is that nobody got hurt."_ He got up, and helped everyone to get out and they started to pack stuff.
<br /> &nbsp; I was sitting at the edge of the ramp, watching them. When everyone was ready to leave, Eric came back to the ship. _"Well, that was interesting adventure"_ he sounded relieved. _"I'm sorry..."_ i said, as he sat down next to me. _"Cheer up girl, it's okay"_ he said and he hugged me... I felt so.. I can't even describe it. _"Please do stop by the city next time you're around, I would like to show you around, take you out for dinner maybe..."_ I just nodded, and he gently kissed me and walked away... I sat there for a while longer, I was a bit shaken from the experience. I almost got innocent people killed.

 &nbsp; I never found the cargo, those pirates must have gotten to it first. My guess would be that the cargo was already in the Anaconda that I passed the other night, and those Eagles were just a distraction so I'm not following them. It must have been something important. The contract did include a clause that if my ship gets damaged they will pay for repairs, so that's covered as well. What should I do now though?

### Day Three

 &nbsp; The day passed, my ship is in a hangar with repair bots working around the clock. I'm laying on the bed in low gravity of a Coriolis station. I can't stop thinking about him. It's almost noon, i'm surprised that it's taking so long to fix the armor plating on my Fer deLance. There wasn't any hull integrity damage, it shouldn't be that big of a deal.
<br /> &nbsp; _"Incoming encoded transmission."_ Daydreaming will have to wait... My guess is that it's my employer, probably unhappy with my failure to retrieve his precious cargo. _"Answer."_ I sit up and fix my hair. _"Commander Rhea!"_ Obviously annoyed old man on the other side... _"Hello,"_ I replied, with neutral voice. The communication was voice only, otherwise I would nicely bow as it is a custom in the Empire. _"I will tripple the reward if you can find the cargo, but please hurry, it's very important!"_ To be honest I would just fly down to the city and have a small vacation, perhaps my life would change thanks to the young man i met the other day, however, there was something in the voice of this old man that made me very curious what is that cargo, he sounds like he really cares about it a lot. _"I will do my best, my Lord."_ - _"Thank you,"_ did I just hear relief? Interesting. _"End transmission."_

 &nbsp; Repairs are finished, ammunition restocked, time to leave. I catch myself thinking about Eric again, as the Fer deLance raises from the depths of the station to the docking bay. I shake my head, i can't afford a distraction right now. I slam throttle full forward while retracting the landing gear, however without boost, I don't need to be on the docking blacklist here... Boosting inside of a station can do some serious damage. I already made my mind where to next during the conversation with the old man. I chose bad time to leave the station, my destination is on the other side of the planet. I'm in a hurry though... _"Kirea open comms to the surface flight control."_ - _"bleep"_ - _"Zorgon Peterson Romeo Hotel Echo Alpha, requesting landing permission at the Baynes City Spaceport."_ - _"Stand by,"_ following standard protocol, I'm requesting landing permission down in the city. They won't even let you enter their air space around the city without it, it's a big city, busy spaceport. _"Permission granted, proceed to Zone B, Landing pad 34."_ Damn... that's pretty far from the main offices of the planetary security... My plan is to ask about those wrecked eagles, I hope that there will be some kind of sign where did they come from. It will likely involve a fair bit of waiting, I doubt that they took care of the crash site yet.
<br /> &nbsp; _"Kirea open comms to Eric."_ He left me with his ID at least, so I can get in touch with him. _"Come on answer meh..."_ - _"bleep"_ - _"Hello?"_ It's him! _"Hi there,"_ i said, i feel like a teenager, my cheeks are burning too... _"Oh hi! You haven't left yet?"_ - _"I did, I was at the station actually, when i received ... lets say extension of the contract, I am to investigate where did the cargo `disappear` to."_ I didn't want to say too much, I don't know what's going on with this contract but I don't want to risk anything anymore. _"Oh... okay"_ he replied. _"I was wondering... maybe.. if you will have some free time.. I will be in the city today."_ Geez I feel so silly! _"And you would like to go out with me? I'll be more than happy to show you around."_ Pfft, he's even teasing me. _"Okay... Could you pick me up at the space port? We could meet in the hall, Zone B."_ - _"8 o'clock?"_ I nodded only to realise that it's voice only... _"...yes!"_ - _"Okay, see you later then."_ - _"End transmission."_ I lean backwards in my seat, smiling...
<br /> &nbsp; _"Warning, entering upper stratosphere."_ I grab the stick and throttle again, and check the shields status. Most of the medium and smaller ships are aerodynamic and fine to enter without shields, however, I don't need the paint burnt off... It's somewhat fresh afterall hehe... It's always quite a view as the dark sky slowly changes color into blue, with orange plasma mixed with blue flashes of the shield doing its job. Some modified shields have different colour, some are purple and some are green. I opt for the ballanced blue ones usually, they provide good protection with good recharge rates, while the green ones, also called Prismatic, are superior in strength, however they take at least twice that long to charge. Purple ones are the opposite, they are weaker, but they charge very fast. _"Kirea open comms to Baynes City flight control."_ - _"bleep"_ - _"Zorgon Peterson Romeo Hotel Echo Alpha, entering the Baynes City airspace, destination B-34."_ - _"Acknowledged, proceed."_

 &nbsp; I'm nervous and it's still several hours away. I didn't date anyone since i was a kid, which probably doesn't count anyway. Anyway, I still have to visit the security office.
<br /> &nbsp; _"How may I help you?"_ asked an officer at the front desk. _"Hello, I'm responsible for those three Eagles west of the city... or what's left of them anyway."_ I boldly state, and he just stares at me for a second before touching his ear piece. _"Sir, there is someone claiming responsibility for the three destroyed ships. ... Will do, sir."_ He then looks at me, and gestures at the couch nearby. _"Please, sit down, someone will be with you in a moment."_ And so I walk over there, look around, and sit down. Waiting... always waiting... this will take ages, maybe I could get a tea somewhere nearby? _"Excuse me."_ Never mind, someone is walking towards me. It's male officer, with mustache. _"Are you the pilot responsible for the destruction of three Eagles roughly 24 to 36 hours ago?"_ He's looking at my flight suit, his sight stopped on my shoulder, where my combat rank is. The Elite rank looks rather fancy I have to admit. Well, lets deal with it... I stand up and answer _"Yes, I would have some questions."_ - _"You will have to come with me."_ I'm confused, i will -have to- go? _"Lead the way then."_ There is no point arguing with them, especially if you want something from them, which I do...
<br /> &nbsp; So they lead me into small room, one table, two chairs. I believe that this is where they interrogate suspects. Oh well... _"Please sit down and tell me your name and identification of your ship."_ - _"Commander Rhea Ayase would be me, and the ship is Zorgon Peterson, Fer deLance by the name Kirea. Unique ID is Zorgon Peterson Romeo Hotel Echo Alpha."_ I cross my arms as I finish, looking at him seriously. _"Please wait a moment, I have to verify this."_ And so he walks away... what did I say? Lots of waiting... *sigh*
<br /> &nbsp; He returns a few minutes later, _"I'm sorry for the inconvenience Commander, please understand that we can't have people destroying ships all around the planet. Your naval rank is a whole different story though."_ I knew it. As soon as they figure out my rank with the Imperial Navy, they pull their tail. _"I understand, don't worry."_ - _"How may we be of service?"_ He's extremely polite now, it's quite funny how quickly they change their attitude towards people of higher rank or political standing... bureaucracy. _"I was wondering whether you had time to investigate whatever was left of them, I need to find out where did they come from and who they were."_ I hope that they did recover black boxes, or at least transponders, or well, some other parts... _"Well, we did not manage to look into the two that crashed a few hundred kilometers west, however the third that was nearby was completely destroyed, any kind of identification is gone."_ Figured, after meeting them railguns... _"Could you please send me a message as soon as you recover the other two wrecks? These should be fine, they just crashed into the ground. Were there any survivers?"_ - _"Both ships were empty, whether they survived or not I do not know, and transponders were missing as well."_ Now i'm angry! _"Okay, please let me know as soon as you get what's left into the city."_ The officer nodded and opened the door for me. _"Thank you for your time and help."_ I turned back on the other side of the door and bowed, and walked away.

 &nbsp; I'm on my way from the security offices, spacing out all the time, sometimes about the issue at hand, while other times about my upcoming date. I need clothes, I can't go in the damn suit again. I'll wear my favorite skirt and top, but I could use some light, nice jacket to go with it. It's cold at night and i'm not used to natural weather.

 &nbsp; It's almost 8... looking into my tiny mirror under bad lighting in my ship... i'm nervous.

### Day Four

 &nbsp; I'm still sleepy, but it's already light outside... I'll just keep laying here in bed, it's so... beautiful. I'm happy, last night was awesome. We found each other by the terminal entrance, and then he took me to nice little restaurant by the river. I just went with whatever he suggested, and it was a good meal. After we've eaten, he took my hand and lead me to the river. You could see the bridge from there, it has beautiful lights. It was somewhat calm even though we are in a busy city. He hugged me from behind as I was looking at the bridge, and we just stood there quietly for a while. Then he took me to some kind of street marketplace and got a candy for me, they don't make this kind anywhere else in the galaxy apparently. It was something between ice-cream and cotton candy, it was good. The whole evening was nice and it wasn't an awkward silent date you might imagine, we were chatting about our lives, getting to know each other. Oh right, I just woke up in his bed, that's why i'm feeling so awesome, he's holding me close, i hope that he will let go soon though, i'll need to pee. Hey don't get funny ideas though! When we were walking through the street after i finished the candy, he asked if i would like to go to his place, get a feeling of home before I disappear in the void... I was most tempted by nice shower to be honest. Real flowing water huh? I did take that shower when we came here, then he offered me his bed, it's a big one by the way, and he was about to leave the room with a blanket when I stopped him and said that i would like him to stay... He hugged me in the bed and I instantly fell asleep feeling safe and happy.
<br /> &nbsp; _"New message received,"_ Kirea announced through my comms pin. I've got one of the imperial style jewelry-like communication pins, I really like this tech, direct voice link to my ship within a few hundred kilometers. Of course it will recognise only my voice though. Oh, he's awake now as well... _"Good morning,"_ i turn around and smile at him, to receive just a soft kiss. _"I'll have to see what is it, the planetary security office was supposed to let me know when they get those wrecks here so i can take a look."_ I never told him about my business before, I didn't want to mix lovely evening with my work. _"Oh okay, do you have any idea who they were and why were you after you and the cargo?"_ He is curious. _"Nope, no idea. The officer told me that there were neither any survivors, nor dead pilots, and transponders were missing as well. I hope to find some technical marks on the ship that would point me in some direction."_ He is listening carefully, trying to focus on what i'm saying. He is still half asleep hehe...

 &nbsp; I'm on my way to Kirea, I need to change my clothes, the flight suit serves me well as a uniform. You would think that the world would change in a few thousand years, but it didn't, and women are still considered less than men. Some people are happy that for example navy ranks are in one gender only, they see it as equality between genders. I do not, I see it as men trying to force women into acting like men if they want to be recognised. I'm a woman, I'm neither baron nor lord. I wear the suit in public to gain tiny bit of respect thanks to the Elite rank it shows. I'm sitting in a transport train now, it's a fancy one, and it passes over the bridge I mentioned earlier. Love the view. _"Kirea, who sent the message?"_ - _"Lieutenant Antoine Dubois"_ I got out of Eric's apartment without checking the message, I didn't want to over-extend my stay. _"Kirea, play the message."_ - _"Commander Ayase, we have recovered those ships that you've destroyed, we will be waiting for you at the Spaceport zone E."_ Okay, zone E is full of Large pads, makes sense they have an impound nearby. Oh, several people stare at me... probably enjoying the sight of a girl dressed up for a date, listening to Lieutenant Antoine do her bidding.

 &nbsp; So I spent the rest of the day digging through the trash that once was an Eagle. It had obviously modified main engines, and there are only two places they do this kind of modification. I'll head to Farseer tomorrow morning, it's very late and I need some rest.

### Day Five

 &nbsp; _*BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP*_ - _"...what's going on?! Kirea shut it off!"_ Why is the impact warning waking me up in the middle of the night?! I better run to the bridge. _"Status?"_ - _"All systems functioning within specified parameters."_ I notice an incoming ship on the scanner as I jump into the seat.. It's heading right for me. _"Engage thrusters, maximum power!"_ I'm betting on the speed rather than shield strength right now. Boosting off of the landing pad with thrusters full vertical up, slamming the throttle forward really hard, just to hear an explosion behind me and alarm go off... _"Under attack."_ she said. Shrapnel from the explosion I guess. What on earth was that, anyway? _"Kirea, open comms to the flight control."_ - _"bleep"_ - _"This is Zorgon Peterson Romeo Hotel Echo Alpha, I would like to know what just happened on my landing pad B-34!"_ I realise I'm shouting at them... oops? I don't know who is to blame for.. whatever that was. _"Commander Rhea, I'm glad to hear you're okay,"_ well, this guy sounds very informal. _"We've detected it too late to shoot it out of the sky, it was a small ship in silent running on collision course straight down towards your ship."_ - _"Any idea who was the pilot?"_ I need to know how is this connected to my contract. _"Judging from its trajectory, there wasn't one, it must have been pre-programmed."_ - _"Okay, can you please ask Lieutenant Antoine Dubois to keep me posted about this incident as well?"_ I should get out of here, disappear in the void, they are obviously trying to do their best to stop me from investigating this any further... _"Will do, Flight control out."_

 &nbsp; This trip will take a while... I don't like traveling long distances, my Fer deLance is not exactly an exploration vessel, right? I'll need some fuel after this jump, I should be safe there. I went two jumps in wrong direction instead of heading straight for Farseer. _"Frame Shift Drive charging..."_ Carefully watching the heat indicator as it is raising. I'm pretty close to the star. You always jump out towards the star, because only the star has big enough gravity to be able to lock onto it for interstellar jump. _"Three, two, one, engage."_ This will be F-class star, that's hotter than our Sun "back home."
<br /> &nbsp; _"Fuel scoop engaged."_ I'm diving down, dangerously close to the corona. I love to fly underneath bigger stellar flares. It is very dangerous and you need better shields to protect you from radiation and those crazy EM fields. _"Fuel scooping complete."_ Time to continue... _"Frame Shift Drive charging..."_

 &nbsp; This was the last jump, that was one hell of a trip. I left Baynes City around 3 o'clock their time, it's 16:20 now. Farseer seems to have a noon now though, they will be awake at least. _"Warning, interdiction detected."_ Okay, this is interesting. An Eagle is interdicting me. Makes no sense for a lonely Eagle to interdict me, he will have friends. Either way I'm going to throttle down and submit, because it will damage my modules if I don't. Being abruptly pulled out of Supercruise is no fun at all. I better hold tight, here we go! The ship is thrown out, spinning. _"Kirea, enable Flight Assist!"_ That will help stop the madness at least. Throttle to full, boost! Damn all the G's into the seat... urgh... _"Kirea, disable Flight Assist and deploy Hardpoints!"_ Pulling the stick hard, to pitch 180 degrees while boosting again, using my thrusters while I'm half-way through the maneuver, to already reverse my velocity vector. I'm not stopping the maneuver at 180 though, I boost again and continue spinning as the tiny Eagle passes in front of my cockpit. He's done for. I press the the trigger on my Railguns. Synchronized blue flash and an explosion in front of my ship. _"Warning, temperature critical."_ I hear loud thunder-like noise, that's a big one jumping in. Little ones friends, too late for him though. It's a Python. This is no longer fun, it's actually starting to get dangerous. If they have any other ship incoming, I'm screwed. They would have one ship behind me while I'm chasing the other. _"Under attack."_ Damn, he has fixed lasers! My countermeasures are useless! _"Kirea, divert power to engines and shields."_ My weapons capacitor is full, I can fire two salves with that. Lets dance! Pulling up with boost, getting some angular velocity around the big guy, while pointing my guns at him. His fixed weapons can't hit me now, as I'm slightly faster than he can turn. I trigger the huge laser under the belly of my ship just to hear Kirea tell me about incoming missiles. _"Kirea, shields maximum."_ My ship shakes as they explode on my shield, it's down to 72%. Not so good anymore, not at all. I have to change something if I don't want to go for an unplanned EVA. _"Kirea, divert power to engines and weapons."_ - _"Incoming missiles."_ Dammit! Boosting again, I need to get behind this guy otherwise he can maintain the lock on me! _"Shields offline."_ They didn't hold without any power to provide extra strength, however, barely any hull damage yet. _"Kirea, Silent running!"_ It's gonna get hot in here, however, he can't lock on to me now, and as long as I'm not directly in front of him, his fixed weapons are useless! Now who's got the upper hand, huh? Firing my laser, as I see his shield flash - Shield Cell Banks, it's like a capacitor strapped onto the shield generator to quickly recharge it. Time for more firepower to punch through I guess. _"Warning, taking heat damage!"_ - Railguns generate an insane amount of heat. _"Kirea, deploy heat-sink."_ I can eject the coolant and replace it with cold one, I've got twelve of those in total. _"Target shields offline."_ Here we go! I'm gonna go for his drives, I've got more-less good angle now, and Railguns should punch straight through the armour. _*PEW*_ ouu that must have hurt... His drives went from bright blue to dim red. _"Kirea, disable silent running, full power to shields, and open comms to the Python ahead."_ - _"bleep"_ - _"This is Zorgon Peterson Romeo Hotel Echo Alpha, identify yourself or face the void."_ ...no response. Maybe I damaged their computer or comms or something? _"Shields online."_ Kirea announces as a huge explosion blinds my sight. The Python is gone, they've self-destructed. I'm getting no answers again. _"Dammit! Kirea, status report."_ - _"Frame Shift Drive minor damage."_ Whew, I was afraid that I cooked off half of the ship there.

 &nbsp; I'll be safe at Farseer, these guys are known for good security, as long as you're in the hangar that is. There are occasional pirates lurking in close proximity to this base. I hope that I'll get some sleep this time.

### Day Six

 &nbsp; I open my eyes, still sleepy, but I've got job to do. _"Kirea, any messages?"_ - _"One new message, from Lieutenant Antoine Dubois."_ - _"Play the message."_ Getting dressed while listening to it... that suicide ship was another Eagle, and it would seem that it had modified thrusters, just like the rest of them. Well, time to visit Felicity and talk about some business. I'm docked in one of the outside bays, I'll take one of those trains. It's pretty fast mag-lev transport, it would be rather long walk to the control tower otherwise.

 &nbsp; _"Hello, I'm Rhea Ayase, I've sent a request for some upgrades the other day, I'm here to negotiate the deal."_ I'm explaining to the front desk lady, she seems rather clueless... I wouldn't be surprised if she was an Imperial slave. Anyway, she gestured towards the meeting room. _"Hmm.. empty."_ ...someone's coming. _"Hello Commander Rhea, my name is Felicity Farseer, but you can call me Felicity. I heard that you are interested in rather big deal?"_ I messaged them that I would like 10 ships fully tuned to get this appointment. _"Yes, I'm here with my private Fer deLance, so we can begin with that, and if I'm happy with the results, I would like to have 10 Eagles tuned for a tournament. I heard that you are the best engineer to talk to when it comes to these small fighters, that you can do real magic with the drives."_ She sharpened her attention when I mentioned Eagles and their drives. _"Oh, who told you about my Enhanced Drives?"_ I have to be careful and make her ask the questions, which will provide me with the right info... _"I was docked in Achenar for a few days, when half of an Eagle managed to safely fly in and land, while it was missing left wing nacelle - quite a sight I'll tell you."_ She smiled, obviously proud of her work. Good, I should be able to get her brag about it a little. _"Haha yes, I heard the news yesterday, that some Eagle pilots were racing close to the ground and they both crashed. I wasn't aware that the ship was still operational?"_ - _"Yeah I was talking to that pilot, he said that the ship was abandoned there, but still operational with but a few minutes of work he was able to fly it again. There was no sign of original owner so he just claimed it for himself."_ I'm making her uneasy with this, she obviously doesn't like the idea of that ship being in someones hands. This should provoke some action after I leave. _"Anyway about my Fer deLance, can you tweak the drives a bit, to begin with? I've got some other business to attend to later..."_ - _"Okay, i'll send the crew over right away, expect bills together with docking fees on your departure."_ And so I bow the imperial way, smile, and walk away.

 &nbsp; _"Kirea, record all channels and communications. for next 15 minutes."_ It will take me a while to go through all the comms, but I bet that Felicity will contact whoever has those Eagles to tell them off for leaving the ship there. I should also tell Lieutenant about it in case she decides to verify my story. Sitting on the train back to my ship now _"Kirea open comms to Lieutenant Antoine Dubois."_ - _"Hello?"_ he says. _"Hello Lieutenant, this is Commander Rhea again, thank you for the message earlier. I would like to ask you now.. if anyone happens to have too many questions, you've recovered only one completely destroyed ship."_ - _"As you wish m'lady."_ I love those Imperial manners...

 &nbsp; Back in my lovely chair, _"Lets see what did we record... haha this is my own communication with Lieutenant!"_ This will take a while...
<br /> &nbsp; ...I'm starting to fall asleep listening to all kinds of messages. Some were encrypted well, so I listened to the ones with poor encryption first, while these were being munched by Kirea. _"What the hell have you done!"_ Ahaaa this is Felicity, and very angry. Jackpot. _"What are you talking about?"_ Rather surprised male voice. _"Some random nobody recovered one of my Eagles that I sold to you, with my Enhanced Drives! You're lucky it wasn't the authority who got their hands on it, I would have killed you already!"_ I can't help but smile, I tricked her well... _"We will be moving our cargo out of this system tonight, then we are done and you can have your precious drives back for all I care."_ He's an arrogant one. And rich, since he doesn't mind returning those ships he bought. Judging from the accent though, and the lack of manners, this one is definitely not an imperial citizen. My guess is feds, they always stick their nose into Imperial business. Anyway, I've got what I needed, now I just have to pay attention to the traffic. I'm looking for one Anaconda and a bunch of Eagles leaving this system anytime now. It has to be an Anaconda that will carry the cargo, since that is what I encountered the first night. It makes sense, very well armored transport with a bunch of fighter escorts.

 &nbsp; I've been waiting for three hours with my eyes peeled to the scanner now... I'm starting to think that they were talking about different system. I'm tired, it's getting late...

 &nbsp; There! An Anaconda! Lets see what are those ships following it _"hmm..."_ Two Eagles, this fits! Lets grab the Anaconda and take out Eagles first, while they will have disabled FSD from the interdiction. _"Interdiction tether established."_ I hate interdiction, it's a lot of hull stress to the ship, and it will shake all my plushies out of their rubberband holders by the bed. _"Poor bunnies..."_ Here comes the big punch out of the supercruise.
<br /> &nbsp; Okay, now I need to get some distance from the Anaconda. _"Kirea open comms to the Anaconda."_ - _*bleep*_ - _"This is Commander Rhea, stand down your weapons and prepare to be scanned for that you are suspected of carrying stolen cargo."_ I don't even have a cargo scanner heh... But that's irrelevant, they will engage in combat. They just deployed their hardpoints. _"Kirea deploy hardpoints."_ Two eagles appear in a flash of a light. _"Divert power to engines."_ Being pushed into the seat as I boost towards one of the Eagles... _"Warning, under attack."_ And that's the Anaconda behind me. _"Divert power to shields and weapons!"_ And so I gently press the primary trigger, watching the Eagles shield drain under the constant beam of my huge, modified laser. _"Target shields offline,"_ she just said, but by the time she finished, their hull was down to 20%... I have to break off, I'm taking too much damage. Missiles off to this one, pitching up hard and boosting back with complete 180degree turn in a blink of an eye, heading directly head to head against the other Eagle, I fire my Railguns. Three quick blue flashes of my modified Imperial Hammer Railguns... _"Full power to shields!"_ - _"Warning, taking heat damage."_ Those Railguns... _"Deploy heatsink."_ - _"Impact warning!"_ I know my dear... I know. That's why that full shield strength. Squeezing the stick and throttle as I hit the Eagle. It blows up in front of my canopy. _"Shields offline."_ Two down, fat one to go. _"Kirea divert power to engines and weapons."_ I need to get behind them as soon as possible, just like I did with the python the other day. _"Engage silent running."_ This will be much more painful than the Python fight... I have only so many heatsinks to throw out, and only so much chaff. I can neither keep silent-running for more than a brief moment, nor can I keep chaff deployed for too long. I have to show them all the tricks in the book I guess. _"Let's start with this one."_ Boosting towards the Anaconda to get behind them as soon as possible, pitching up with slight forward thrust to make sure that I won't crash into them - that would be deadly without shields. Now I'm in reverse, thanks to disabled Flight Assist. _"Deploy chaff!"_ My eyes peeled to the scanner, waiting for what seems to be an eternity, taking damage from their weapons... It is in fact but a second or two. There, they are 700m away, that's about a second til I'm directly below them. _"Relativity!"_ I laugh out as I boost pitching slightly up, in order to arrest my reverse velocity and position behind them... Giant Anaconda appears right in front of me and I'm staring at their main thruster exhaust. _"Disable silent running, full power to weapons,"_ I calmly instruct Kirea as I trigger both the beam laser and those Railguns. My opponent's shield is flashing, pulsing with Shield Cell recharge in progress. They don't know that my Railguns are modified to disrupt those. I'm not giggling at all, watching them try... _"Target shields offline."_ - _"Target drives."_ Missiles off to blow them up.
<br /> &nbsp; _"Open comms to the Anaconda."_ - _*bleep*_ - _"Ceasefire!"_ he screams at me. _"So again then, I am looking for stolen cargo canister. I believe that you remember me back on the night side of.."_ - _"Yeah yeah take it!! This is not worth my life, or my ship."_ Well well, it wasn't that hard, other than most of my hull plating on top of my lovely ship being blown to pieces form that close pass... chaff doesn't help much at that distance. Scooping the cargo as they manage to fix their drives, their shields are up again... must be those bi-weave ones, they were pulsing purple while they were trying to use the Shield Cell banks. _"Under attack."_ huh? He didn't have enough?! I have to bail this, my shields are still down. Cargo is in, boost it is, away from them... _"Damn Felicity!"_ They are keeping up.. _"You and your modded drives."_ Flight Assist off, pitch up and roll slightly, boosting mid-maneuver using both lateral and vertical thrusters... The best one-eighty turn I can pull off. Boosting right by the Anaconda. Charging FSD - by the time they turn around I'll have a good 3-4km between us. _"Byeee!"_ - _"Shields online."_ - _"You're so late my dear..."_

 &nbsp; I finally arrived to the Trade Post in Delta Phoenicis after pulling an all-night shift in the pilots seat. I wouldn't risk sleeping somewhere with the damn cursed cargo and almost destroyed ship... Walking down the ramp, slightly corpulent man in fancy robes is standing in front of my ship, looking at it steaming, hull plating torn apart... My heart hurts at this sight... _"I've got your damn cargo."_ I'm obviously not happy... _"Don't worry, your ship will be like new. Please get some rest in our ambassadorial suite."_ The most expensive and fancy thing the Empire has to offer huh? I'll take it. My own pool in this nice station with a few palm trees around it. But first, I'll get some sleep.

 &nbsp; I wonder what was in the cargo container...
