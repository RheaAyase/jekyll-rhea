Everything cloudy, everyone gloomy.
<br />
Everything white, everyone looking.
<br />
All so bright, all so sudden.
<br />
Blindfolds shutting, all eyes crying.

It eased away, behind the milky.
<br />
Above fluffy snowflakes, under creamy milk.
<br />
Stretching to the horizon, sunrays melt red.
<br />
Everyone smiling, kids cheery.

All so white again, all so sad again.
<br />
Everything cloudy here, everyone gloomy here.
