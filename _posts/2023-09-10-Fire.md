This is a story of self discovery, freedom of expression, passion and responsibility. Based on real events and characters, it takes shape of an irregular diary, a collection of small independent stories. Featuring BDSM lifestyle, some may consider it to be NSFW, however it is but a day in my life. Certainly 18+ though! So do not proceed if you're not of age or maturity.

### Fire

_The fire that melts the ice,_
<br>_The fire from your eyes,_
<br>_The fire that softens even a domme's heart,_
<br>_The fire that passionately whips you hard,_

_That is my deepest love for you,_
<br>_That is my ownership of you._
<br>_Remember the leash of chains,_
<br>_Round your neck a collar remains._

_Her neck,  so soft, so fragile,_
<br>_With my hand wrapped around for a while._
<br>_My fingers, strong to grip the hair,_
<br>_Helpless, she grasps for air._

_My thighs squeezing her waist,_
<br>_Her hands tied to struggle, to rest._
<br>_The fear in her eyes,_
<br>_Hidden joy, beneath it lies._
