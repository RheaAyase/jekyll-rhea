Feeling bad about yourself won't help you,
<br />feeling bad about crappy life won't help you.
<br />I'll offer a shoulder to cry on,
<br />but I will also encourage you to fight and carry on.

My mum died a few years ago, just before Christmas... I cried.
<br />Then I stood up and I fought.

My sister died last Christmas... I cried again.
<br />I got fired when I called for a day off, for the funeral.
<br />I was half a year without any income... I cried a lot.
<br />Then I stood up and I fought.

I almost died in a surgery... I was scared and I cried.
<br />I stood up and insisted on another, to fix me.

Fuck you life. I'll beat you in the end.

<br />It's okay to cry, as long as you get up afterwards.
<br />Try to use your own will-power to change your life, don't wait for someone else to do it for you. Gather your strength and do it! _Imagine Shia LaBeouf_ **:**p
<br />Let me know if you need a hug =]
