I'm currently in long-distance relationship. It is neither easy, nor too hard or annoying, love will always find its way, right? My boyfriend, Eric, was coming over for Christmas, or rather, we were traveling to visit my family together. It didn't go well in the beginning...

### Airport

**Thursday the 22nd December.**

We both got up at 7:30 in the morning. He took a bus to the airport in Lulea, Sweden, while I spent three hours in the bathroom and packed up all the things. By the time I was leaving the house he was already waiting for 2nd plane in Stockholm, this one would have taken him to Prague, but it was delayed half an hour. I went to a cosmetic salon to have my eyebrows done, and since I was there, why not have some nice makeup done as well.. It was supposed to be a nice evening together afterall.

And I left for Prague. I live in Brno and it is about 2 hours of speedy highway trip. I arrived to the airport and parked, and that moment I received a message saying that his flight was canceled. :( ...But it's okay, they gave him 2nd flight through Berlin, he would arrive "only" 4 hours later than he was supposed to. So I spent a few hours in coffee shop at the airport, and then he said that this german flight is delayed... them terrorists. I was barely holding tears at this point, he tried to find out whether he can get to me the same day or not... It did not look promising.

I went to a nearby hotel when he got on the plane to Berlin, I got there, got a room for 2 - hope dies last. As soon as I closed the door on the room I cried. He did not make it, he had to stay in Berlin that night.

And that's not all. That hotel was awful, it was really really cold, there was no hot water, and the terrible cold water that i could use, smelled like sewers.

### Prague

**Friday the 23rd December.**

He came, he finally came at noon! We had lunch near the airport where we looked at google maps and figured out where to go in Prague - we decided to spend the day there instead, and travel in the evening. _Thanks dad for ideas about Prague!_

We walked all over Prague for hours, we had fun together.

### Christmas with family

We spent the next day with my family: my father & his wife, my sister & her husband, oh and the little naughty dauther of theirs!
