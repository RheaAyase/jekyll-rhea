Another talk at another conference type of thing. [Everything ready](https://github.com/RheaAyase/dotnettalks.demo4), including myself. Surprisingly everything was so smooth, that I have literally nothing to write about (as opposed to the [previous one]({{ site.url }}articles/2017-07/Microsoft-TechTalks-Prague))

Easy morning without rushing, picked up a package in the office and went for lunch. Then the talk, ate pizza, went to a pub with the Microsoft team and others, had some fun, and chat... _\*shrugs*_

It was simply a good day with a small exception of temperature - it was insanely hot and the black tshirt didn't help it. I hope that everyone could actually hear me and I didn't do something I don't know about, like... cover the microphone with my naughty hair :D
