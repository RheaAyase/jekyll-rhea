This is a story of self discovery, freedom of expression, passion and responsibility. Based on real events and characters, it takes shape of an irregular diary, a collection of small independent stories. Featuring BDSM lifestyle, some may consider it to be NSFW, however it is but a day in my life. Certainly 18+ though! So do not proceed if you're not of age or maturity.

### Quality Time

This little piece is partially a story, a slice of my day, and partially an important message. It's important to have some quality time together with your partner, whether it's a pet, slave, your queen or a spouse. This quality time can be of various importance. The following short story depicts a day of my life, including various levels of quality time with my partner, my pet. I enjoy all of it.

### Clingy pet

Waking up can be difficult when you're being tested by the entire universe. Having someone to wake up for though makes it
a bit easier. I'm out of my bed, rushing downstairs for my first meeting of the day, I shout at my pet to wake up. "Yes
mistress" she mumbles in a way that you'd normally not understand, but I'm used to deciphering the morning mumbles now.
She's got just enough time for the bathroom stuff while I'm in my meeting, after which she will be right here with me.
"Sit," I tell her as she walks to my office, she sits next to me, hugging my leg. "Good morning?" Still sleepy, mumbles
again "Good morning mistress..." She gets a headpat, but I can't seem to free my arm now. It was attacked by a cuddly
beast that hugs everything in sight. Oh well.

Eventually I get my breakfast and drink served and I carry on with my work. Little servant cleans the house and gets to work
on projects of her own.

The day has gone by and she starts to cook dinner. I wrap up my work and join her in the kitchen. I like to combine food
with movies, so my dining portion of the kitchen is actually a cinema with 80" TV. We watch some silly youtube videos
while she makes dinner, then we eat our dinner with an episode or two of some nice series we both enjoy. I often end up
being a pillow on the sofa, but sometimes, sometimes I'm the smol cuddle monster :)

Once we finally break free of each other, we get to play a game together. This can be a pancake game, a VR game, or
VRChat, which isn't exactly a game, but a nice activity together non the less. You can stay in VR for so long though, it's
nice to get some fresh air occasionally. One of my favourite forms of quality time is going out together. Walkies. That
and cuddles in bed before falling asleep, talking about all kinds of things. But you [already know all about that!]({{ site.url }}/articles/2022-11/Walkies) :)

### Conclusion

I very much enjoy having a clingy pet, all of the above is amazing. What's your quality time? Talk about it with your
partner, make sure that you both understand what the other considers good quality time.
