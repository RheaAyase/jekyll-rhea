Portfolio? What's that? Okay I'll try... But it's gonna be a story, or at least a little bit.

## Education

- 2010-2013: Faculty of Information Technology - Brno University of Technology

I graduated from a technical high school in Slovakia, where I learned an excessive amount of Math, Physics, a few
languages and.. Pascal! Yes I had to learn Pascal and later Delphi. We had an excessive amount of ASM and a bit of CAD
(AutoCAD, OrCAD) as well as HTML, PHP, CSS etc.. And that was just my "secondary school" eh.

From there I went to Brno, Czech Republic, to spend 3 years of my life learning how to... do more things in Assembly? No
seriously we had some C as well at the Faculty of Information Technology of Brno University of Technology. Oh and at some
point I've done some Cisco network academy courses - CCNA or something. Also some classes where we learned how to break
into "secured" wifi networks and such. A bit of everything, really.

## Who am I?

I'm a jack of all trades at work, as well as in life. I can code, I can draw, I love music. I can drive large vans, cars and motorcycles on either side of the road, and I shred the mountain trails and jump off of cliffs on a bicycle. (Or rather, I used to, now live in the flatest part of England.) I like playing Airsoft, video games often multiplayer on PC, but we also have a nice couch gaming setup with Wii, PS3, PS5, SteamDeck, GPD Win4, PS Vita, PSP, DSLite, GBA, and some handheld arm/linux emulators. 3D printing retro video game figures (pokemons and the likes). Oh and since I'm also a linux/server nerd, of course I have a server rack at home, hosting not only my own stuff (nextcloud, etc) but also all kinds of open source projects and game servers. Paired with 10gbps fibre through-out the house. Yes I drilled the holes and installed it all - in every house I move to - every single year... I'm tired, I'd love to have some stability now. Please karma, when will you start paying up all the good deeds? _\*mic drops\*_
