Portfolio? What's that? Okay I'll try... But it's gonna be a story, or at least a little bit.

## Education

TLDR:

- 2010-2013: Faculty of Information Technology - Brno University of Technology

I graduated from a technical high school in Slovakia, where I learned an excessive amount of Math, Physics, a few
languages and.. Pascal! Yes I had to learn Pascal and later Delphi. We had an excessive amount of ASM and a bit of CAD
(AutoCAD, OrCAD) as well as HTML, PHP, CSS etc.. And that was just my "secondary school" eh.

From there I went to Brno, Czech Republic, to spend 3 years of my life learning how to... do more things in Assembly? No
seriously we had some C as well at the Faculty of Information Technology of Brno University of Technology. Oh and at some
point I've done some Cisco network academy courses - CCNA or something. Also some classes where we learned how to break
into "secured" wifi networks and such. A bit of everything, really.

- 2016-2022: Red Hat - Senior Software Quality Engineer - .NET QE Lead
  - Tech Lead responsible for delivering .NET (Core) to the Enterprise Linux, working closely with both internal and
    external partners and customers.
  - Got to play with Linux servers every day, Bash, Python, C#, all kinds of CI/CD systems, version control, RPM
    packaging,
- 2022-2025: Ubisoft Reflections - Senior Gameplay Programmer
  - Core gameplay feature ownership spanning various gameplay teams (3Cs, Vehicles, Interactions, ...)
  - Shared code between future 3A multiplayer games.
  - Anvil and Snowdrop game engines.
- 2025: Yet another misfortune I'm not ready to talk about in public.
- 2026-present: Clearly the reader of this is my future employer, right?!

I was yoinked out of school by a small game dev studio, where my first task was to fix issues with a port of Angry Birds Trillogy on PS Vita. This project had 160 000 lines of C++ code in one file, mostly one function (main update). It was ported from Lua. You know what they say, learn to swim by being thrown into the deep end eh? The fun didn't end there though, a while later we were working on World of Tanks, the original one. It had Python gameplay code with Russian documentation that we did not understand and the game engine was C++ code full of Ozzy slang! :D

Some time later I was approached by Red Hat - they were growing their .NET team and liked that I had experience with both, C# and Linux. During my time with Red Hat I was promoted a bunch and my salary doubled. I felt appreciated at least for a while and at least by some people. One good metric of my impact that I can mention is that when I started, the Linux updates for .NET Core 1.0 lagged months behind Microsoft releases and when I left, it was down to minutes. I got to attend, present and represent both Red Hat and Fedora at many conferences and even help organise some. I enjoyed being in the Open Source community and contributing to it, whether it was technically, or socially.

## Projects involved in

Professionally only, there were many more open source, personal projects, small and large.

- Angry Birds Trillogy (PS Vita)
- Angry Birds Star Wars (PS3, PS4, XB, XB1, Wii, WiiU, 3DS, Blackberry, I'm probably forgetting some..)
- Angry Birds GO! (Android, iOS)
- World of Tanks (The original one, BigWorld C++ engine, python gameplay code, and C#/Unity prototypes)
- NDA 3A multiplayer game (PC, PS5, XBSX)
- NDA 3A multiplayer game (PC, PS5, XBSX)
- NDA 3A massively multiplayer game (PC)
- The .NET (x64, aarch64, s390x, ppc, containers/OpenShift \| RHEL7, RHEL8, CENTOS, Fedora,..)
- Presented at many .NET and OpenSource conferences, meetups and events.
- Actively contributing to many open source projects and communities.

On a more personal level I strive for better and more secure communities online. I run infrastructure that provides server hosting for various open source projects, I create tools and bots that help manage communities and protect from spam, and I do my best to uphold values of privacy in doing so. It's been 10 years and a few months since I set off on this mission and I still keep it up, through all the hardship in my life. What's that, a new phishing scam? I'll quickly implement the countermeasures. My community management tools are used by many open source and Linux communities, including for example Blender, Manjaro, Arch, OpenSUSE and many many others. And somewhat obviously, also Fedora Linux Discord community which I founded eons ago and manage to this day.

I'm a jack of all trades at work, as well as in life. I can code - I love Open Source, I can draw - I hate generative AI, I love music - from classical through folk to metal and anything in between. I can drive large vans, cars and motorcycles on either side of the road, and I shred the mountain trails and jump off of cliffs on a bicycle. (Or rather, I used to, now live in the flatest part of England.) I like playing Airsoft, video games often multiplayer on PC, but we also have a nice couch gaming setup with Wii, PS3, PS5, SteamDeck, GPD Win4, PS Vita, PSP, GBA and multiple different DSes. 3D printing retro video game figures (pokemons and the likes). Oh and since I'm also a linux/server nerd, of course I have a server rack at home, hosting not only my own stuff (nextcloud, etc) but also all kinds of open source projects and game servers. Paired with 10gbps fibre through-out the house. Yes I drilled the holes and installed it all - in every house I move to - every single year... I've been living a nightmare ever since I moved to the UK, but that's a story for another time. I'm tired, I'd love to have some stability now.

If you haven't received my more detailed (and structured) CV already, reach out and ask! I removed my email from my website due to excessive spam, but you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhea-gustavsson) if you'd like to get in touch.
